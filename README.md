# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the variation in the data. It is widely used in data analysis and machine learning for tasks such as data visualization, noise reduction, and feature extraction.

This repository provides an implementation of PCA along with example use cases and instructions on how to use the code.

## Features
- Perform PCA on a dataset
- Visualize the principal components
- Example use cases and datasets

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here are the basic steps to perform PCA using the code in this repository:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pca import PCA
```

2. Load your dataset:
```python
# Example: Load a dataset from a CSV file
data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')
```

3. Perform PCA:
```python
# Initialize PCA with the desired number of components
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Fit the model and transform the data
transformed_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
```

4. Visualize the results:
```python
plt.scatter(transformed_data[:, 0], transformed_data[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.title('PCA Result')
plt.show()
```
